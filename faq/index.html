  <li><a href="#i-want-a-refund">I want a refund</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-connection-halts-with-purchase-required">The connection halts with “Purchase required”</h4>

<p>First, make 100% sure that <strong>you are using the Apple ID you purchased the required products with</strong>.</p>

<p>After that, give this a try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disable the VPN for 1-2 minutes</li>
  <li>Try to enable it again</li>
</ul>

<p>If that doesn’t help either, please drop an e-mail to issues@passepartoutvpn.app with the app and tunnel logs grabbed at the time when the “Purchase required” message appears.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-share-the-purchases-with-my-family">Can I share the purchases with my family?</h4>

<p>Yes, all purchases support Family Sharing.</p>

<p>If a family member still cannot access the purchases, some users have reported that enabling purchase sharing <strong>for the family member</strong> fixed their issue. Exactly, make sure to enable purchase sharing for the <em>receiving</em> member. It looks like some weird behavior of the Apple infrastructure, but I strongly suggest you give it a try.</p>

<h4 id="the-app-is-stuck-on-receipt-validation">The app is stuck on receipt validation</h4>

<p>Validating Apple purchases for the first time may take up to one minute, especially if the device was just booted. If warning signs appear on your profiles -meaning that validation failed-, please close and reopen the app and everything should be fine.</p>

<h4 id="i-want-a-refund">I want a refund</h4>

<p>Refund requests must be submitted to Apple at the following link:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="apple-tv-profiles-do-not-sync-after-upgrading">Apple TV profiles do not sync after upgrading</h4>

<p>For profiles to sync properly on your TV, ALL apps must be upgraded to 3.0.0 or newer, not only the Apple TV. Make sure to upgrade your iOS and macOS apps and you should be good to go.</p>

<h4 id="my-profile-does-not-appear-on-the-apple-tv">My profile does not appear on the Apple TV</h4>

<p>If you are using the latest app, and the iCloud and TV icons are barred, this is a sign of iCloud not working or a feature not being credited. Kill and reopen the app, and make sure that the “iCloud” or “Apple TV” features are enabled in Settings &gt; Purchases.</p>

<p>Make sure that the Apple ID of the <strong>default account</strong> of the Apple TV is the same Apple ID of the iOS/macOS device you are sharing the profile from. I could be wrong, but it seems to me that other accounts don’t get proper iCloud updates like the default account, i.e. the one you set up the Apple TV with.</p>

<h4 id="why-use-icloud-to-share-profiles-with-the-apple-tv">Why use iCloud to share profiles with the Apple TV?</h4>

<p>As of December 2024, the Apple TV is still limited when it comes to file transfers. AirDrop and iCloud Drive are the most natural options for one-off “import and delete” of a profile, but they are not available. Another option is setting up a local server with a QR, but I find it quite a cumbersome UX.</p>

<p>Therefore, given that Passepartout supports end-to-end CloudKit encryption, iCloud proved a decent trade-off between usability and privacy. Besides the convenience of the simple toggle, the iOS/macOS apps act as a remote to reflect local changes instantly on your Apple TV. This benefits the UX of the TV app dramatically, where you only use the remote to change the profile or toggle the connection.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that only “Apple TV” profiles are shared and synchronized over iCloud implicitly. Other profiles follow the “iCloud &gt; Enabled” toggle (in 3.0.0) or the global iCloud app preference (before 3.0.0).</p>

<h4 id="does-it-work-with-homekit">Does it work with HomeKit?</h4>

<p>Reportedly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/passepartout/comments/1kpv5ii/does_using_passepartout_on_the_apple_tv_break/">it doesn’t</a> (yet).</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="icloud">iCloud</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#i-am-concerned-with-icloud-privacy">I am concerned with iCloud privacy</a></li>
  <li><a href="#i-cannot-see-my-profiles-on-another-device">I cannot see my profiles on another device</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="i-am-concerned-with-icloud-privacy">I am concerned with iCloud privacy</h4>

<p>Starting from version 2.2.0, iCloud synchronization is opt-in and disabled by default. Those upgrading to 2.2.0 will still see the option enabled to reflect the current app state, but you may disable it at any time. Rest assured that version 2.3.0, however, introduces end-to-end profile encryption.</p>

<p>If you mean to recover the best privacy, after disabling iCloud from the app, you may erase the existing store so that your profiles only stay on your device. If that is not enough, enter your iCloud settings, look for Passepartout inside “Manage Account Storage” and tap “Delete Data From iCloud”.</p>

<h4 id="i-cannot-see-my-profiles-on-another-device">I cannot see my profiles on another device</h4>

<p>Make sure that all your devices are updated to the latest version of the app.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>

</ul>

<h4 id="network-settings-are-not-effective-without-a-vpn">Network settings are not effective without a VPN</h4>

<p>The DNS, HTTP Proxy, and Routing modules are effective reliably when paired with a VPN module. DNS may work without a VPN, but in general this is not officially supported by Apple.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#the-standalone-mac-app-doesnt-work">The standalone Mac app doesn’t work</a></li>
  <li><a href="#can-i-install-the-mac-app-store-version-and-the-standalone-version-side-to-side">Can I install the Mac App Store version and the standalone version side to side?</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-standalone-mac-app-doesnt-work">The standalone Mac app doesn’t work</h4>

<p>Make sure that the app is installed in the /Applications folder and nowhere else. After that, double check that Passepartout is enabled in the Mac preferences section “Login Items &amp; Extensions” &gt; “Network Extensions”.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-install-the-mac-app-store-version-and-the-standalone-version-side-to-side">Can I install the Mac App Store version and the standalone version side to side?</h4>

<p>This is not advisable. While it’s true that they are two completely different apps, their VPN profiles might trump each other because they live in a shared space. You might end up losing data, therefore, you’d better stick with only one of the two.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="i-can-connect-to-the-vpn-but-the-internet-does-not-work">I can connect to the VPN but the Internet does not work</h4>

<h5 id="mtu">MTU</h5>

<p>Historically, Passepartout has used a low MTU setting (1250 bytes) in order to maximize compatibility, at the cost of performance. iOS version 1.13.0 -and any macOS version- supports tunnel MTU customization. With this update, it sounded reasonable to also leverage a standard (higher) MTU (usually 1500).</p>

<p>If such a change is making the app struggle in your environment, I encourage you to try lowering the MTU.</p>

<p>Add a “Routing” module to your profile and specify a custom MTU value. Decrease incrementally until you restore the VPN operation.</p>

<h5 id="compression">Compression</h5>

<p>Most of the time there could be a mismatch in compression framing. E.g. server is using LZO compression framing whereas the client is not, or vice versa. Sometimes the app gracefully shuts down with “Compression unsupported”, sometimes the error can be subtle and packet transmission could just fail silently, resulting in no data exchanged over the wire.</p>

<p>Therefore, make sure that compression directives are compatible between client and server before looking into routing issues. Also read the next FAQ entry, as it may be another cause of a dead data link.</p>

<h5 id="dns">DNS</h5>

<p>Last but not least: make sure that you’re not experiencing a simple DNS issue. Try pinging a remote machine by IP address: if that works, then DNS is the culprit. This usually happens when your server, whatever the reason, doesn’t push public DNS servers to clients.</p>

<p>There’s a quick workaround: add a “DNS” module in your profile and add an explicit DNS server address. That should fix it.</p>

<h4 id="the-vpn-fails-with-auth-failed-or-immediately-disconnects-with-encryption-failed">The VPN fails with “Auth failed” or immediately disconnects with “Encryption failed”</h4>

<p>This may happen when you rely on default OpenVPN encryption, which is normally Blowfish (BF-CBC). The algorithm, besides being unsupported by Passepartout, is also weak and therefore discouraged. In order to fix this issue, you must switch to AES encryption. Passepartout only supports AES, be it in CBC or GCM mode.</p>

<p>Set encryption explicitly in the server configuration, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cipher AES-128-CBC
auth SHA1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and don’t forget to update the client .ovpn as well with the <strong>exact same parameters</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to leverage newer AES-GCM encryption, you could just use:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ncp-ciphers AES-256-GCM
# or
ncp-ciphers AES-128-GCM
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the client wouldn’t need to change a thing, because the algorithm will be enforced by the server no matter what.</p>

<h4 id="my-provider-returns-auth-failed-but-my-credentials-are-correct">My provider returns “Auth failed” but my credentials are correct</h4>

<p>Bear in mind that some providers require specific credentials for their direct OpenVPN servers. That’s why Passepartout, in those cases, has a convenient link at the bottom of the OpenVPN “Credentials” screen, showing you where to find such credentials on your provider’s website.</p>

<p>Regarding Mullvad in particular, remember to strip spaces from the username.</p>

<h4 id="my-personal-server-returns-tls-failed">My personal server returns “TLS failed”</h4>

<p>This may happen with older ciphersuites when verifying peer against the CA. You should upgrade your server certificates to a more modern standard (e.g. RSA no less than 2048-bit).</p>

<h4 id="the-configuration-file-lacks-a-required-option-cipher">The configuration file lacks a required option (cipher)</h4>

<p>When missing, OpenVPN implies a Blowfish cipher, which is severely obsolete and unsupported. Passepartout requires that you set an AES cipher instead. For that to work, you must update your OpenVPN server and client configuration to use AES by explicitly setting a cipher (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cipher AES-128-CBC</code>).</p>

<p>Recent servers might still be pushing a modern cipher option (normally AES-GCM), but Passepartout enforces an explicit client <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cipher</code> to avoid <a href="#the-vpn-fails-with-auth-failed-or-immediately-disconnects-with-encryption-failed">another subtle issue</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-configuration-file-contains-an-unsupported-option-external-file">The configuration file contains an unsupported option (external file)</h4>

<p>Due to easier interoperability, the app does not support external files in the .ovpn main configuration. That’s because more often than not, it may not make sense referring to relative paths in a mobile device environment. Think of the Mail app for example. The fix is straightforward though, say you have an external <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ca</code> file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ca my-ca.crt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just replace it with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ca&gt;
...
content of my-ca.crt
...
&lt;/ca&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same applies to other settings like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cert</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tls-auth</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tls-crypt</code>. In the specific case of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tls-auth</code> with a key direction, like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tls-auth ta.key 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Replace with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;tls-auth&gt;
...
content of ta.key
...
&lt;/tls-auth&gt;
key-direction 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="it-seems-that-my-traffic-doesnt-necessarily-go-through-the-vpn">It seems that my traffic doesn’t necessarily go through the VPN</h4>

<p>Talking about OpenVPN, unless <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redirect-gateway</code> is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explicitly added to the .ovpn configuration</li>
  <li>Pushed by the server</li>
</ul>

<p>the default gateway is NOT changed. That is, your external IP won’t be the VPN’s IP. This is not the case for provider profiles, though, where the default gateway is always <em>enforced</em> to be the provider gateway to avoid unintended leaks.</p>

<p>Try <a href="https://www.iplocation.net/">this website</a> to test your external IP before and after this change.</p>

<h4 id="my-provider-profile-stopped-working-after-upgrading">My provider profile stopped working after upgrading</h4>

<p>Version 3.2.3 changed the way providers are stored, make sure to upgrade all your devices to the latest version to use the new profiles.</p>

<h4 id="id-like-to-use-wireguard-with-providers">I’d like to use WireGuard with providers</h4>

<p>I’m working on it.</p>

<h4 id="my-provider-is-not-listed">My provider is not listed</h4>

<p>You should contact with your provider to double check if there is interest in being added to Passepartout. Beware that some may be concerned instead. Ultimately, you can submit your provider request for a viability review to <a href="mailto:providers@passepartoutvpn.app">providers@passepartoutvpn.app</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mullvad-ignores-my-custom-dns-settings">Mullvad ignores my custom DNS settings</h4>

<p>It looks like Mullvad “hijacks” DNS on default endpoints, making custom DNS settings irrelevant. In order to do custom DNS with Mullvad, make sure to explicitly pick the “Custom DNS” preset, which will let you connect to the UDP:1400 and TCP:1401 endpoints. These endpoints do support custom DNS servers instead.</p>

<p>Until version 1.7.0 for iOS, you will have to do a manual “Refresh infrastructure” in order to access the new preset.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="why-dont-shortcuts-execute-in-the-background">Why don’t Shortcuts execute in the background?</h4>

<p>They finally do!</p>

<p>Starting from version 3.0.0, Passepartout stores one VPN configuration per profile. This means you can build your workflows directly from the Apple Shortcuts app and that they can execute in the background.</p>

<p>Use the “Set VPN” action in Shortcuts and pick your profiles by name. Beware that having on-demand enabled may affect some automation.</p>

<p>The “Connect to provider server” automation is a bit more complex but will be restored soon.</p>

<h4 id="my-vpn-never-triggers-despite-on-demand-being-enabled">My VPN never triggers despite on-demand being enabled</h4>

<p>Think of other apps that may affect VPN behavior, even other VPN apps. An user once reported that “Parental control” prevented the VPN from starting.</p>

<h4 id="the-mac-app-doesnt-work-when-installed-from-a-dmg">The Mac app doesn’t work when installed from a .dmg</h4>

<p>For the VPN to work, the app must reside in the /Applications directory, and Passepartout must be enabled as System Extension. Open the macOS Preferences, scroll to ‘Login Items &amp; Extensions’ &gt; ‘Network Extensions’, open it and enable Passepartout.</p>

<h4 id="the-suggested-wi-fi-ssid-is-always-empty-on-macos">The suggested Wi-Fi SSID is always empty on macOS</h4>

<p>This worked until macOS 10.15 (Catalina). After that, Apple decided to hide the SSID of the connected Wi-Fi, and there is no workaround at the time of writing (May 2025).</p>

<h4 id="id-like-to-see-a-widget">I’d like to see a Widget</h4>

<p>I’m working on it.</p>

<h4 id="on-demand-including-doesnt-work-as-expected">On-demand “Including” doesn’t work as expected</h4>

<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/partout/issues/10">known issue</a>, and I’m working on it.</p>

<h4 id="im-on-wi-fi-but-my-device-shows-im-connected-via-lte">I’m on Wi-Fi but my device shows I’m connected via LTE</h4>

<p>The Wi-Fi/LTE icon (replace LTE with any cellular signal) while on VPN has been broken since iOS 10 or the like. It’s something that Apple is unable to fix or doesn’t bother fixing.</p>

<p>You should do a simple test. Verify your data consumption with your LTE provider website, normally phone providers have that. Now, when on VPN and the LTE icon appears in spite of Wi-Fi, download a relevant chunk of data. You may then learn that the plan is unaffected, implying that you’re actually connected via Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>I haven’t found a workaround for this and it’s been there for almost two years. Yeah, it’s a shame.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-location-access-required-when-adding-a-wi-fi-network-to-on-demand">Why is location access required when adding a Wi-Fi network to on-demand?</h4>

<p>Starting from iOS 12 (or 13?), iOS has restricted what apps can learn about Wi-Fi networks. Location access has become a requirement to access the SSID of the connected Wi-Fi, which is crucial to add it to on-demand networks.</p>

<p>That’s why, starting from iOS app 1.9.0, Passepartout will prompt you for a location permission when adding a Wi-Fi network. Make sure that location services (under “Privacy”) are enabled on your device, otherwise the app will be unable to ask the permission in the first place.</p>

<h4 id="id-like-to-see-my-ip-address-in-the-app">I’d like to see my IP address in the app</h4>

<p>The reason why Passepartout does not present any personal information in app is <em>privacy</em>. Obtaining one’s IP address, regardless of being connected to a VPN or not, involves querying -and trusting- a third party service. Knowing such info is also of little use, given that most of the time you don’t want to share your VPN IP address and therefore link your identity to it. However, this feature might be introduced later as a diagnostic tool.</p>

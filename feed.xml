I like to share what I’m working on, and in future posts, I’ll talk about how GitHub Projects helps me plan the development of Passepartout without losing my mind.</p>

<p>Here I present a sneak peek of what 2025 has been so far, and what I envision for the remainder of the year.</p>

<h2 id="short-term">Short-term</h2>

<h3 id="stability-again">Stability, again</h3>

<p>Reaching stability after <a href="/2025/03/rewriting-passepartout-for-v3/">rewriting Passepartout v3</a> has been <em>extremely</em> challenging. Despite being a mid-to-small project, it’s insanely hard to keep track of all the tiny details and edge cases covered in such a long development history. Regressions (i.e. features that used to work but are broken by an update) are just inevitable.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people have realized that <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/releases">Passepartout has seen 14 updates</a> in less than two months. The criticism, the problems with in-app purchases, and the unforgiving reviews that most customers don’t care to update when a problem is fixed. The funniest part was those blaming me for being a “money grabber” at a time when the cost/benefit ratio of working on Passepartout was at a historical minimum. I worked up to 100/week while seeing sales going down 60%.</p>

<p>But I’m still alive!</p>

<h3 id="providers-api">Providers API</h3>

<p>The JSON API of Passepartout has been a drag for too long. The time has come to rework it because it’s also a privacy concern for providers, API calls should be authenticated. The outcome will be a better overall integration and support for WireGuard in providers. Mullvad is likely to be the first one because of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mullvadvpn/comments/1gmf2id/removing_openvpn_15th_january_2026_blog_mullvad/">more stringent deadline</a>.</p>

<h3 id="standalone-mac-release">Standalone Mac release</h3>

<p>This is the one I’m mostly excited about: releasing Passepartout as a .dmg for macOS, outside of the App Store. The app will be limited to free features until I implement a way to receive payments without the App Store.</p>

<h2 id="mid-term">Mid-term</h2>

<h3 id="more-providers">More providers</h3>

<p>A direct consequence of a better-designed API is making room for more providers.</p>

<h3 id="more-protocols">More protocols</h3>

<p>I’d rather disclose this later, but I’d like to extend the suite of supported VPN protocols. Maybe more than just VPN.</p>

<h2 id="long-term">Long-term</h2>

<h3 id="new-platforms">New platforms</h3>

<p>A long-term goal that will not make it to 2025, but that’s been on the back of my head, is opening up to non-Apple platforms. There’s nothing concrete yet, but I’ve been designing the new codebase with this in mind.</p>

<h2 id="the-app-is-already-better-than-v2">The app is already better than v2</h2>

<p>Lastly, I want to spend some words on the new app.</p>

<p>We usually take things that work for granted and complain about things that don’t. It’s human nature. Over the years, I learned that a silent customer is a happy customer and that a noisy one may be right, but not that often.</p>

<p>Even when the update was receiving the biggest hate, I knew that the app would be better, but I could not blame the users “for not seeing it”. An app like Passepartout is best when you don’t notice that it’s running.</p>

<p>I know that the app is better from an engineering perspective. Let me tell you, instead, 1% of why v3 is better <em>as an user</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better battery consumption</li>
  <li>Super-low crash rate</li>
  <li>Native Mac app</li>
  <li>Mac menu consistent with the app</li>
  <li>Per-profile iCloud sync</li>
  <li>TV app is beautiful and sync is reliable</li>
  <li>Shortcuts run in the background</li>
  <li>Stable UI with consistent L&amp;F and animations</li>
  <li>Much better provider server selection</li>
  <li>Custom light/dark appearance</li>
  <li>Interactive login</li>
  <li>Route custom DNS inside/outside VPN</li>
  <li>Edit WireGuard configurations</li>
  <li>Convenient OTP field for OpenVPN (WIP)</li>
  <li>Plenty of resolved OpenVPN bugs
    <ul>
      <li>Connection stuck randomly</li>
      <li>Occasionally stuck when Wi-Fi/Mobile roaming</li>
      <li>Regularly stuck when back from sleep</li>
      <li>Disconnection on “Message too long”</li>
      <li>Disconnection on “No buffer space available”</li>
      <li>Disconnection during renegotiations</li>
      <li>Slow to reconnect</li>
      <li>Memory leaks</li>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

If our skills improve at a faster pace than we maintain our software, its design will start to drift away from our standards and expectations. If we let the gap increase for too long, it will eventually be impossible to catch up, and we’ll end up hating our creations.</p>

<h2 id="version-2-was-a-mess">Version 2 was a mess</h2>

<p>Passepartout used to be two separate iOS and macOS apps, with all the complications that this implies. In 2022, I used Passepartout to learn <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> –I considered Flutter initially– and make v2 a partially multiplatform app. Partially because the macOS app was a hybrid <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Catalyst/iPad</a> app, a terrible choice if I think of it today. I don’t even know why I did it, but whatever.</p>

<p>The conclusions I drew after v2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SwiftUI is very hard to get right. I had to rewrite my views multiple times due to my wrong understanding of the framework.</li>
  <li>Catalyst made the macOS app an ugly and unstable iPadOS app, let alone a complete nightmare to develop.</li>
  <li>The time I spent on the Mac system menu, in particular, was beyond ridiculous. Maybe I’ll dedicate a post to this clunky Catalyst/AppKit interaction.</li>
  <li>The app core was overengineered, untested, untestable, and confusing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit">TunnelKit</a> was already unmanageable and inextensible. Touching the wrong line could break connectivity for thousands of users.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m aware that we, developers, occasionally suffer an innate tendency to be unsatisfied with our choices, whatever they are. Redoing the same things over and over is detrimental to making progress, though. Therefore, rewriting software should <em>never</em> be your first choice. That’s why I ruminated around the idea for months, but the rewrite was inevitable 7 years after the first release.</p>

<p>Users don’t and can’t realize the amount of bugs that Passepartout v2 and TunnelKit had. The codebase, <em>my codebase</em>, was such a high barrier that it took me a year (2022 to 2023) to resolve some legitimate concerns with iCloud. Requests/bugs were sadly flowing at 30x the speed I was able to address them. The app was half abandoned.</p>

<p>It’s, however, very risky to rewrite an app that was stable, making decent money, and required very little support despite a user base in the hundreds of thousands. To end up, one year later, with the same app with more or less the same features.</p>

<p>Rewriting must be <em>really</em> worth it.</p>

<h2 id="the-costbenefit-of-rewriting-software">The cost/benefit of rewriting software</h2>

<p>Version 3 is the last time I <em>intend</em> to attack the foundations of Passepartout.</p>

<p>So many times I rewrote code in my life with the sole intent of working in a “beautiful” codebase, not realizing how quickly the enthusiasm wanes when the development routine is back to normal. Give it a few months and, no matter what, your codebase will look “ugly” again. It never ends.</p>

<p>I learned not to rely on “beauty” to bring me back to the joy of programming. After all, when I wrote those nasty lines 10 years ago, I probably thought it was the state of the art. Right?</p>

<p>Today, I try to refactor software as a regular exercise, but at a smaller scale, and with a different purpose:</p>

<p><strong>Make my changes last as long as possible.</strong></p>

<p>Below is what I did in 2024 –part-time until August– for this major update:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/passepartoutvpn/projects/1/views/4?filterQuery=">The GitHub Project for v3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/passepartoutvpn/projects/1/views/8?filterQuery=">The tasks split by goal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The project encompassed ~1000 items, of which ~350 are invisible for being in private repositories. An insane amount of work, in hindsight.</p>

<p>Today, I can confirm that it was by no means a waste of time. After one year of development, the success of this reengineering is summarized in a sentence:</p>

<p><strong>Most areas of Passepartout won’t need to be modified for years to come.</strong></p>

<p>This is the single measure you want to focus on when considering a big architectural redesign: the time you save in the long run must dramatically compensate for the effort of rewriting. With this mantra, good design will be the natural consequence. Because good design, ultimately, is meant to save development time.</p>

<p>The best code of your software is the one you forget about, the one you don’t need to touch ever again.</p>]]></content><author><name>Davide De Rosa</name></author><category term="development" /><category term="refactoring" /><category term="planning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For software to live a long life, it must grow together with our experience.

For iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.</p>

<p>I dare to say, automated releases are hardly (if <em>ever</em>) seen in open-source *OS apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a>, created by <a href="https://krausefx.com/">Felix Krause</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> helped me immensely with the fast turnaround of Passepartout releases. In the era of LLMs, you have no excuses to waste time for not using these incredible tools.</p>

<p>Let me show why CI/CD is one of the most important and underestimated aspects of making indie software, or software in general.</p>

<h3 id="its-just-an-app-right">It’s just an app, right?</h3>

<p>Many people are confident that <em>The Idea</em> is the most valuable aspect of a product.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you developed an app for the App Store, at any level of complexity, you know how exhausting the whole process is. There is so much more than “writing the code”, which is nothing trivial to start with.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-store-requirements-will-beat-you">The App Store requirements will beat you</h3>

<p>Choosing the icons. Crafting the screenshots. Writing the metadata. Picking the categories. Localizations. The business model. In-app purchases. Sorting out the legal aspects. The App Review process. And so on.</p>

<p>Wait, have I mentioned the codesigning process? Development, Ad-Hoc, Distribution. Multiple platforms. Debug and Release.</p>

<p>Especially at the beginning, it’s overwhelming and discouraging. We’ve all been there.</p>

<p>The 15-30% cut that Apple takes from your revenue is almost a marginal cost compared to all this.</p>

<h3 id="the-fear-of-change">The fear of change</h3>

<p>Here’s a very subtle side-effect of the above: once your tedious setup finally works, you might <em>refrain from changing</em>.</p>

<p>Some relatable examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I change the UI, I will have to change the screenshots for X languages and Y platforms.</li>
  <li>If I alter some inner logic, I will get a rejection from Apple.</li>
  <li>If I introduce a regression, I will get bad reviews.</li>
  <li>Even if I have a hotfix in time, Apple will push my release back for silly reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>It goes without saying, this is an atrocious outcome for your product. If you work alone with no one to delegate these annoyances to, you risk falling into the ultimate recipe for failure.</p>

<p><em>Stagnation is the hidden cost of expensive deployment.</em></p>

<h3 id="you-must-learn-to-automate">You MUST learn to automate</h3>

<p>The key to keeping focus on the product is <em>automation</em>. It’s boring at first, but in the long run, it’s your best bet against the inevitable frustration of using App Store Connect.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you find yourself doing 3+ times the same task, automate it.</li>
  <li>If a task doesn’t need constant interaction, automate it.</li>
  <li>If a task is sensitive to human mistakes, automate it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Observe your routine and you will soon realize how many hours you are wasting on dumb tasks, time you could have spent on useful features for your customers.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration-is-underused">Continuous integration is underused!</h3>

<p>After 15 years working with Apple devices, I can still confirm this trend: the vast majority of iOS developers don’t know jack about <em>continuous integration</em>. Which is crazy because fastlane has been around since 2014. GitHub Actions has a shorter history, but there have always been alternatives: Travis-CI, GitLab, Circle-CI, and whatnot.</p>

<p>In the next posts, I’ll show you how I used fastlane and GitHub Actions to automate the release of Passepartout for iOS, macOS, and tvOS at once.</p>

<p>However, a couple of regressions were still haunting me.</p>

<p>Here I want to describe the absurd journey into one of them, that started with a report <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/issues/1204">from GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/passepartout/comments/1j0lbqa/not_open_in_sonoma_any_idea/">one from Reddit</a>. Both users were reporting that the Mac app was crashing on launch.</p>

<p>The reports led me to think that the regression was caused by the macOS version, or the CPU architecture, as both users were using an Intel-based machine.</p>

<h3 id="the-xcode-organizer">The Xcode Organizer</h3>

<p>I had several (unhelpful) crashes in the Xcode Organizer confirming the issue:</p>

<div class="h-scrolling">
    <img alt="Xcode Organizer" src="/s/posts/2025-03-03-01.png" />
</div>

<p>Looking further into some crashes, I could spot a few SIGILL (Illegal Hardware Instruction) that reinforced the idea of a platform-related issue. Add to that, one of the threads had intense Core Data + CloudKit activity ongoing. It must be Core Data, I thought, given that Passepartout performs its sync precisely when the app launches.</p>

<p><em>Doubt #1: how can the app launch at all if the arch is unsupported?</em></p>

<p><em>Doubt #2: is the Core Data stack trace relevant? Is it the thread that is actually crashing?</em></p>

<h3 id="never-read-crash-reports-only-once">Never read crash reports only once</h3>

<p>Passepartout is a privacy-oriented app. There is no external framework e.g. Firebase to help with crash resolution, so Xcode is the only technical resource at disposal. Plus the patient support from the affected users.</p>

<p>Eventually, Core Data was a distraction. Every report was crashing on “Thread 0”, i.e. the main thread. There were also crashes from macOS 15 and ARM64. Fewer, but non-zero.</p>

<p>This stack trace shed some light in that the injected AppDelegate could be the culprit. But where? And why?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Thread 0 Crashed:

<h3 id="reproducing-the-crash-pt-1">Reproducing the crash (pt. 1)</h3>

<p>Assuming that the AppDelegate was doing something wrong, there was even a much bigger issue: I could not reproduce the crash on my machine. I realized, though, that a friend of mine had an Intel MacBook with macOS 14, so I asked for his help.</p>

<p>He gave me access via AnyDesk to push ad hoc builds to the machine. The latest app version crashed consistently. Off to a good start. At that point, I spent a few hours trying to exclude potentially offending parts from the launch code, sadly to no avail. Consider that any change in the code implied archiving and sending a build via AnyDesk to test it. It was exhausting, and the afternoon led nowhere.</p>

<h3 id="reproducing-the-crash-pt-2">Reproducing the crash (pt. 2)</h3>

<p>I decide to give a shot to virtualization. Most crashes came from macOS 14, and not necessarily from Intel machines, so this could work. These were the steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> to run a VM on Mac. <em>Highly recommended!</em></li>
  <li>Download a restore image for Sonoma (~14GB)</li>
  <li>Regenerate the provisioning profile with the VM UDID</li>
  <li>Send the development build via a shared folder to the VM</li>
</ul>

<p>The app crashes. Hooray!</p>

<h3 id="git-to-the-rescue">Git to the rescue</h3>

<p>Time to locate where the regression was introduced. I rebuilt the app for each commit that sounded relevant, and after 10-20 builds, I found out that the crash was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1200">this pull request</a> about the light/dark mode picker in the app preferences. WTF?!</p>

<p>It turns out, the widely used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapp"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> singleton</a> is an <strong>implicitly unwrapped optional</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@MainActor
var NSApp: NSApplication!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it was therefore used unsafely in this bit of the PR:</p>

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpassepartoutvpn%2Fpassepartout%2Fblob%2Fv3.1.1%2FPackages%2FApp%2FSources%2FUILibrary%2FBusiness%2FAppearanceManager.swift%23L66-73&amp;style=default&amp;type=code&amp;showBorder=on&amp;showLineNumbers=on&amp;showFileMeta=on&amp;showFullPath=on&amp;showCopy=on"></script>

<h3 id="a-race-condition-about-nsapp">A race condition about NSApp</h3>

<p>It’s finally revealed that, very early in a Mac app lifecycle, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> may be nil. This was more often the case on macOS 14 than 15, but still a hideous race condition.</p>

<p>Here goes the simplified stack call:</p>

<ul>
  <li>main</li>
  <li>AppDelegate.init</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.init</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.systemAppearance.didSet</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.apply()</li>
  <li>NSApp.appearance = …</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last call, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> may be nil and implicitly unwrapped, leading to the crash.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>

<p>This was one of those bugs that make you question everything—platform differences, architecture quirks, even Core Data conspiracies—before revealing a simple yet insidious root cause: a race condition with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code>.</p>

<p>The takeaway? Even well-documented singletons aren’t always safe to assume as non-nil. And when debugging obscure crashes, patience and a systematic approach (plus a good VM setup) can make all the difference.</p>

<p>Passepartout v3.1.5 <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1224">will handle this case properly</a>, ensuring that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> is accessed only when it’s actually available. Hopefully, that’s one less obscure crash lurking in the shadows.</p>

<p>To Apple and Swift: isn’t it about time to discourage/deprecate the use of implicitly unwrapped optionals?</p>]]></content><author><name>Davide De Rosa</name></author><category term="development" /><category term="swift" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One month after its first, painful release, Passepartout v3 is close to being stable.]]></summary></entry></feed>
